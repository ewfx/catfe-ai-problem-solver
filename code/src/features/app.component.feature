Feature: App Component Load and Registration

  Scenario Outline: Verify App Component Loads and Registration Functionality
    Given the "<module>" component is loaded
    When the user attempts to register with username "<username>" and password "<password>"
    Then the registration result should be "<expected>"

    Examples:
      | module       | username    | password      | expected                 |
      | app.component | validuser   | validpassword | Registration successful |
      | app.component |             | validpassword | Username is required     |
      | app.component | validuser   |               | Password is required     |


```

This feature file addresses the core requirement of verifying the app component load implicitly (the scenario will fail if the component doesn't load successfully before the steps can execute) and explicitly tests the registration functionality across various scenarios (valid and invalid input).  The `module` parameter is included as a potential hook for future expansion (e.g., different components or modules could be tested by modifying the `Examples` table).  The `ui_elements` from the context are not directly used here because the specific UI interactions aren't described.  If specific UI elements need to be validated, those would need to be included in the steps definitions and likely within the `When` and `Then` clauses.
